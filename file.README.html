<p>This module manages the installation and configuration of all services and
tools required to run an ISPConfig server node. Currently it contains
everything needed for a setup according to the current Debian 10
PerfectServer Tutorial from howtoforge.com with modifications for the
already suggested replacement of amavis+spamassassin with rspamd.</p>

<h2 id="label-Description">Description</h2>

<p>Install, configure and manage all services required to host web services
with ISPConfig on your nodes.</p>

<p>Each host managed with this module can be set up as full hosting node (all
services) or with the specific configuration to run a node dedicated as
master, dns, mail or web/db server.</p>

<p>It further automates the deployment of a manually created SSL Certificate
(paid) or obtaining one for the hosts FQDN via letsencrypt. All services
that depend on a valid certificate, like postfix, dovecot, isp panel,
pureftpd, get provisioned with that certificate.</p>

<p>In Addition the module places a default ssl nginx host on its FQDN with
links to all locally installed customer web interfaces like mailman,
phpmyadmin or roundcube. There will be no link to rspamd. On the mailserver
it is also configured at yourhost.fqdn/rspand/, but as it is no interface
for customers, it is not listed in public.</p>

<h2 id="label-Setup">Setup</h2>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"># in your data.yml, default is master only for multiserver master and ISPConfig panel
isp3node::mode: full
# in your site manifest
inlcude isp3node
</code></pre>

<p>Alternativly you can include the isp3node class with a mode parameter
<code>class {&#39;isp3node&#39;: mode =&gt; &#39;full&#39;}</code> or
directly include one of the provided server profiles like this: -
<code>include isp3node::profiles::full</code> - <code>include
isp3node::profiles::master</code> - <code>include
isp3node::profiles::dns</code> - <code>include
isp3node::profiles::mail</code> - <code>include
isp3node::profiles::web</code></p>

<h3 id="label-Required+configuration">Required configuration</h3>

<p>The following configuration options need to be present in your data files.
These are important project-specific settings and thus I do not set any
defaults to it.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">isp3node::email: your@e.mail
# FQDN of the master node, used in the manifests to determine if a node is the current master in your setup
isp3node::master: your.master.fqdn
isp3node::mariadb::root_password: supersecret
# User and Password to use from this host to connect to the master database during ISPConfig Setup or Update
# Do not use username root! This conficts with a resource that is created in the mysql installation manifests setting your local root access
isp3node::mariadb::connect_master::user: isproot
isp3node::mariadb::connect_master::password: supersecret
# If running as postfix satellite, FQDN of the used relay server
# The relay server will automatically add IPs of all its satellites to the mynetworks config variable
isp3node::postfix::satellite::relay: isptest02.spicyweb.de
# ISPConfig needs some configuration that can not be made with camptocamp-postfix module, so we need to use an own template
# That cannot be overwritten on module level, so you have to place this option on site level in your data files
postfix::params::master_os_template: isp3node/postfix/master.cf.debian.erb

# Configuration for phpMyAdmin session encryption and access to phpmyadmins config tables
isp3node::phpmyadmin::setup::blowfish_secret: supersecret
isp3node::phpmyadmin::setup::controlpass: supersecret

# Credentials to access mailmans admin settings
isp3node::mailman::configure::admin_email: your@e.mail
isp3node::mailman::configure::admin_password: supersecret
</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-What+isp3node+affects">What isp3node affects</h3>

<p>Well, the installation and configuration of about every service needed for
ISPConfig. Especially dovecot, fail2ban, php and postfix config is hardly
set by isp3node or additional modules used for service management. So if
you want to change congigurations for one of the installed services, safest
way is to use possibilities that are already given in this module or create
a pull request to extend the code to be able to apply your config changes.</p>

<p>The installation of ISPConfig itself it does only affect by creating remote
users with privileges on dbispconfig.* for your ISP slave servers. The
module further brings the deployed (hiera) or obtained (LE) SSL Certificate
in place for the ISP Panel, but it does not install ISPConfig for you. That
last step is still up to you.</p>

<h3 id="label-Setup+Requirements">Setup Requirements</h3>

<h4 id="label-PuppetDB">PuppetDB</h4>

<p>The IP List for allowed satellites to send mails using a standalone Postfix
as relay is obtained from PuppetDB. So a setup running a PuppetDB along
with your puppet master is a must.</p>

<h4 id="label-Hiera+Data">Hiera Data</h4>

<p>Some parameters for managed services need to be set for your project.<br>
Thats because I dont want to spread my mail address over the net and
receive all your LetsEncrypt notifications but also because no one shoud
know passwords that are set on your installation.</p>

<p>As alternative to blow up variables passed from the highest to the lowest
class, I decided to just define them in hiera. Less possible mistakes by
forgetting to pass a variable and such.</p>

<p>Long story short: The parameters in <em>Required configuration</em> above
are mandatory in your hiera data. So you can use this module only in
conjunction with data files in your project.</p>

<h3 id="label-Beginning+with+isp3node">Beginning with isp3node</h3>

<p>Add and configure the parameters from <em>Required configuration</em> in
your hiera data files.</p>

<p>Then add <code>include isp3node</code> to a host to install everything
required for an ISPConfig3 Master Panel server (not ment to host customer
data, really only made for panel and master database).</p>

<h2 id="label-Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>As said before, first make sure to add the required configuration to your
data files. I recommend to use eyaml for storing passwords, secrets or
private keys in yaml files, but that&#39;s up to you.</p>

<p>By default this module installs requirements for the master database and
ISPConfig configuration panel, but not to host customer sites, DNS or mail
accounts. To set up your host for a different role, you can choose from
different roles: - full: Complete installation from HowtoForge perfect
server tutorial for hosting everything on one machine - master: Prepared to
host the master DB and the panel. In fact just an installation of
&#39;web&#39; with some not required features stripped out. If you
don&#39;t want to have a dedicated master, just use a full or web node as
master. - dns: BIND9 DNS Server - mail: Postfix MTA and dovecot, usable as
mail relay for all other servers - web: nginx webserver and MariaDB server
configured for public access</p>

<p>You have different options to set a role for your host: - Set it on import
in class style: <code>class {&#39;isp3node&#39;: mode =&gt;
&#39;full&#39;}</code> - Set it in a host-specific hiera file:
<code>isp3node::role: full</code> - Directly import the desired isp3node
profile: <code>import isp3node::profile::full</code></p>

<p>There is no risk in importing the desired profile as the main class does
nothing else than that.</p>

<p>The profiles on the other hand just import the main setup classes of the
required components, some with additional parameters. So if you need a
special scenario, you can peek into the profiles and build your own one
featuring a public accessible database, jailkit, Mail and DNS. Just include
the desired service setup classes. (PS: Mail with rspamd still requires
nginx for access to the rspamd dashboard).</p>

<h2 id="label-Limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>Currently this module is limited to Debian 10 only!<br> It will not work on
any other OS as a lot of distributionspecific configuration is contained in
a OS-Version-Datafile for Debian 10.</p>

<p>Further it does not install or update ISPConfig for you. You still have to
do that on your own.</p>

<p>Be also warned that some of the services managed by this module will have
any manual configuration changes overwritten on next run of your puppet
agent.<br> For some services there already are variables in the
configuation classes to insert some custom config. So first dig into there
and look at the documented parameters of the classes.<br> If you cannot
find anything there to make your desired configuration managable, I welcome
senseful feature requests or, if you are in hurry, pull requests.</p>

<h2 id="label-Development">Development</h2>

<p>Because I am as most human beings limited to 24 hours per day and am doing
this in my spare time, I highly appreciate developers willing to push this
module forward with me. So if you want to introduce a change in this
modules code, please open a pull request.</p>

<p>A great description in the PR would describe the reason for the PR and
telling details about what it changes and what else it could affect.</p>

<h3 id="label-Importent+for+all+chages">Importent for all chages</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Extract configurations, package names and so on into the data files</p>
</li><li>
<p>Set up a default configuration that makes sense with a minimum of
configuration requirements</p>
</li><li>
<p>Require but do not include sensitive information like passwords. I think
they should be forced to be set even in a testing environment.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Speaking of: TEST. Test your changes with all predefined server roles.
There is no automated test suite yet. So set up test VMs or such and assing
the different roles to it (maybe the same VM again and again with reset to
a snapshot in between)</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-In+case+of+bugfix+or+code+improvement">In case of bugfix or code improvement</h3>

<p>Please open an Issue first and describe the bug. In your Pull Rerquest
please refer to this issue and explain the solution.</p>

<h3 id="label-In+case+of+new+features">In case of new features</h3>

<p>If you are adding new managable features or possibilities of fine-grain
configuration to existing services or a new service at all, please start by
opening an issue. Describe the new feature that you want to implement, why
and to whom it is important.</p>

<p>If possible, your new feature for an existing feature should take place in
a dedicated subclass of that service, that is to be included by the
services main setup class. Yes, that will not work for all services.
Especially when they are managend through 3rd party modules requiring to
pass the whole configuration at class initialization …</p>

<p>For introducing new services, please stick wherever possible to my class
pattern having a main class importing first a setup class followed by a
main config class and additional feature classes. That keeps the code units
small and maintainable.</p>

<h3 id="label-In+case+of+new+OSses">In case of new OSses</h3>

<p>I can only test and maintain the code for Debian from 10 up. I dont have
any other servers in my possession and especially with CentOS or RedHat too
few practical experience.</p>

<p>So if you want to introduce a different OS than Debian, I invite you to
become maintainer for isp3node regarding to this OS. - Add the OS specific
data files listing required packages - make required changes (especially if
supporting non-APT and dpkg related OSses, as that is used a lot in this
module) - Test it on your OS, I will do so on debian - Create your pull
request - Be ready to pick up the co-maintainer hat for your OS</p>

<p><em>Sidenote:</em> As mentioned before I can support only debian. That is
why I will remove OSses without active maintainer.</p>
